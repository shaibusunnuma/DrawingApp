# DrawingApp
Drawing app created with Android Studio and Kotlin
Basically through this app I learned how to use canvas, import images as well as export drawings from the app to gallery
This app allows users to draw on a plain canvas or import an image and draw on it.
It also allows users to save their drawings to their gallery.
Thes app was inspired by Sylvain Saurel's paint application built with Java
I used Kotlin instead of Java and and this made everything simpler in my opinion.
I had read about the simplicity of Kotlin before I started these projects but this one really made me see it for myself.
After comparing my code with his, I realised I had used way simpler and smaller code to achieve the same results.
